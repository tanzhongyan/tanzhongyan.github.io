                <h3>Coursera Google Advanced Data Analytics Course</h3>
                <img src='./internship.jpg' alt='internship' width="50%">
                <p>During my y1 summer break, I did an internship with KPMG SG as a data analytics intern.<br>
                    I mainly did documentation and development of PowerBI dashboards.<br><br>
                    Whenever I had free time, I would complete onlines courses, and this was one of the ones that took me the longest. <br>
                    Here is my <a href='https://github.com/tanzhongyan/Coursera-Advanced-Data-Analytics' target="_blank">GitHub Repo</a>.</p>

                <h3>Summer Thailand Trip</h3>
                <img src='./ferriswheel.jpg' alt='ferriswheel' width="50%">
                <p>Before my internship started, I went to Thailand with my girlfriend for 8 days. <br>
                    It was my first time being in Thailand, and I have to say it was a eye opening experience.<br>
                    Takeaways:
                    <ol>
                        <li>People are so friendly and patient.</li>
                        <li>Life moves at a slower pace.</li>
                        <li>Things are not cheap there.</li>
                        <li>I sweat more in Singapore even though its hotter there???</li>
                    </ol>
                    Here's another image of me with dogs. I was chubby then, but I'm still chubby now.

                <h3>Clickbaiting People</h3>
                <img src='./notmyson.jpg' alt='notmyson' width="50%">
                <p>I like to clickbait people with my nephew because people think that we look alike. <br>
                    I am quite fond of children as they are so cute and do the darnest things ever. <br>
                    Honestly the only thing that is stopping me now is money, so if you're watching this please give me opportunities. <br>
